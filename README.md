# EBCDIC to ASCII Converter

This Python project provides a simple solution to convert EBCDIC-encoded files to ASCII format. It enables seamless interoperability between legacy systems using EBCDIC and modern applications expecting ASCII-encoded data.

## Features
- Converts EBCDIC files to ASCII format
- Supports various EBCDIC character encodings
- Efficient and easy-to-use solution

## Usage
1. Install Python (version 3.1 or above) from [python.org](https://www.python.org)
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/jmonaste/ebcdic-to-ascii-converter.git`
3. Run the converter script: `python converter.py [ebcdic_file] [ascii_file]`
4. Specify the EBCDIC file path and the desired output ASCII file path as command-line arguments
5. The converted ASCII file will be generated with the provided file path

## Dependencies
The project relies on the `codecs` library, which is a standard Python library and should be available in most Python installations.
